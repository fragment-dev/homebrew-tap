# homebrew-tap

A private homebrew tap to install FRAGMENT tooling
To install the stable version, run `brew install fragment-dev/tap/fragment-cli`.
To install the beta, run `brew install fragment-dev/tap/fragment-cli-beta`.

Note that these both link `fragment` to `usr/bin`, so you can only have one installed at a time.
